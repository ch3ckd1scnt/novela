Elon Musk is being criticized for appearing to send BiPAP machines, not
life-support ventilators, to a hospital in New York.

In a tweet, New York City Hospitals thanked Musk and Tesla for sending
"40 ventilators" to Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, New York. The photo
appears to show a BiPAP machine, which is more commonly used for
problems like sleep apnea, rather than one of the larger, more expensive
life-support ventilators that hospitals around the country are asking
for to treat coronavirus patients.



Musk has said that he would supply ventilators to hospitals where there
are shortages, and that [he would use Tesla factories to produce
some][2].

The ventilators sent to the hospital in Queens, however, appear to be
made by a company called ResMed, which [told the Financial Times][3]
that "we think it's great that Tesla purchased bilevel non-invasive
ventilators," more commonly referred to as BiPAP machines. "We applaud
any company who can help get ventilators and other respiratory products
to those in need," the company said.

The use of BiPAP machines to treat coronavirus patients is
controversial. [Kaiser Health News reported][4] that using the machines
with a face mask could aerosolize the virus, causing it to potentially
spread faster. The American Society of Anesthesiologists similarly [said
in February][5] that using CPAP or BiPAP machines "may increase the risk
of infectious transmission."

But, the [FDA recently said][6] that CPAP and BiPAP machines could be
used as an alternative to traditional life-support ventilators as
hospitals around the country face shortages of the larger, more complex
and costly ventilators.

Musk [said in a tweet][7] on Thursday that "all hospitals were given
exact specifications" of the machines, and that "all confirmed they
would be critical." He added that delivery of more intensive ventilators
made by Medtronic would be delivered in New York City Thursday evening.

Still, some on Twitter were quick to criticize Musk for possibly
overstating his actions, recalling past public snafus [like Musk's
infamous "funding secured" tweet][8].
