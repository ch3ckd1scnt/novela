[Rep. Nydia Velazquez said Monday ][1]that she's been "diagnosed with
presumed coronavirus infection," three days after she spoke on the House
floor and stood near 80-year-old House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the
signing of the [$2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill][2].

In a statement, Velazquez, D-N.Y., 67, said she first started feeling
sick "in the wee hours of Sunday morning."

"I developed the abrupt onset of muscle aches, fevers, nasal congestion
and stomach upset. I noticed that I could no longer smell my perfume or
taste my food. After speaking with The Attending Physician by phone, I
was diagnosed with presumed coronavirus infection," Velazquez said.

"My symptoms are mild at the present time and I am taking Tylenol for
fever, and isolating myself at my home. At the advice of The Attending
Physician, neither COVID 19 laboratory testing nor a doctor's office
visit was recommended. I am carefully monitoring my symptoms, working
remotely and in constant contact with my staff."

Dozens of members of Congress had to rush back to Washington, D.C., on
Friday to vote after[ Rep. Thomas Massie][4], R-Ky., said he planned to
try to force a recorded vote on the stimulus package, which required a
quorum of [at least 216 members ][5]to be in attendance.

His effort failed, and the bill ended up passing by a voice vote,
anyway.

Velazquez [tweeted Friday][6] that was she was "back in DC as we prepare
to pass the #coronavirus stimulus package."

"There are reports one GOP Member may delay this bill, but make no
mistake, we WILL pass this bill for families, workers & small
businesses," she said then.

A spokesman for Velazquez said she'd traveled to Washington on Thursday
night and returned to New York on Friday.

Photos from the signing ceremony show her standing behind Pelosi,
D-Calif., at the bill signing and later chatting in close quarters with
Pelosi and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.

A spokesman for Pelosi, Drew Hammill, said she's "consulted with the
Attending Physician who found her contact to be of low risk and
recommended the Speaker take no particular action."

To date, five members of Congress have tested positive â€” Reps. Joe
Cunningham, D-S.C.; Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla.; Mike Kelly, R-Pa.; and
Ben McAdams, D-Utah, as well as Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.
