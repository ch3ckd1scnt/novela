Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, made his
debut at Trump's daily coronavirus briefing Thursday night. Kushner,
recently put in charge of a [parallel coronavirus panel][1] working on
supply lines, criticized governors who don't know how many masks and
ventilators they have in store.

"What a lot of the voters are seeing now is that when you elect somebody
to be a mayor or governor or president, you're trying to think about who
will be a competent manager during the time of crisis," Kushner said.
"This is a time of crisis, and you're seeing certain people are better
managers than others."

  

  

Kushner, 39, has criticized New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) in internal
White House meetings over the past week, saying Cuomo is being [alarmist
about shortfalls][2] in ventilators and other equipment, [Gabriel
Sherman reports at _Vanity Fair_][3]. "I have all this data about ICU
capacity," Kushner said, according to a person at the meeting. "I'm
doing my own projections, and I've gotten a lot smarter about this. New
York doesn't need all the ventilators." Kushner also reportedly bragged
last month, "I know how to make this government run now."

So far, voters [seem more impressed][4] with the competence of their
governors than Trump's. An [_Associated Press_ /NORC poll][5] conducted
March 26-29 found that 57 percent of Americans approve of their state
government's coronavirus response, versus 44 percent who approved of
Trump's response and 38 percent the federal government's response. "In
individual states, governors — most of whom are briefing the media and
their residents on a daily basis — have seen their approval ratings
shoot through the roof," [Reid Wilson reports at _The Hill_][6].

  

  

As for Kushner, who's now "making life-or-death decisions for all
Americans," he has "succeeded at exactly three things in his life,"
[Michelle Goldberg writes in a _New York Times_ op-ed][7]. "He was born
to the right parents, married well, and learned how to influence his
father-in-law. Most of his other endeavors — his biggest real estate
deal, his foray into newspaper ownership, his attempt to broker a peace
deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians — have been failures."
