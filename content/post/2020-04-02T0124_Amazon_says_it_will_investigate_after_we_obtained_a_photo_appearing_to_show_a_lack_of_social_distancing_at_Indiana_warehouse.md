Amazon says it will investigate a photo that appears to show managers at
one of its warehouses failing to abide by the company's stated policy of
social distancing during the novel coronavirus pandemic, the company
said Wednesday.

The photo was sent to Business Insider by an employee at an Amazon
fulfillment center in Jeffersonville, Indiana, who wishes to stay
anonymous citing fear of retaliation.

The photo appears to show three people crowded around a small table,
none wearing protective gear, standing by a whiteboard that says, "Your
safety is our highest priority. Please work together to ensure social
distancing is happening."

Employees at an Amazon warehouse in Indiana huddle for a meeting next to
signs encouraging employees to stay apart.

In mid-March, the online retailer announced it would be [following
recommendations][2] from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
that would require employees to remain six feet apart at all times. It
also stopped holding "stand-up" meetings, which workers complained had
required them to stand shoulder to shoulder at the beginning of their
shifts.

The employee who provided the photo, taken March 31, claims the
company's dictates are routinely flouted by managers.

"This is normal," they claimed. "They're at that table every day, all
day long, sometimes more than three of them. And nobody's saying
anything to them."

In a statement, Amazon insisted that all operations sites are enforcing
safety measures. "Any situation in which teams don't follow social
distancing guidelines will be immediately investigated," spokesperson
Rachael Lighty told Business Insider.

Workers in at least 19 Amazon warehouses have tested positive for
COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, as of March 30.

Clark County, where the Indiana facility is based, has [confirmed 38
cases][3] of the novel coronavirus, reporting its first death on April
1.

"We're risking our lives for a pair of tennis shoes," the employee at
the Indiana facility said in an interview.

"A lot of people still aren't wearing gloves or washing their hands,"
they continued. "It's a breeding ground for the virus."

On Monday, over 100 workers at an Amazon warehouse walked out to protest
what they claim are unsafe working conditions, demanding that the
company conduct a deep cleaning of the facility.

One of the organizers of that protest, Chris Smalls, was then fired for
[what the company said][4] was a violation of an order to self-
quarantine after having "had close contact with a diagnosed associate
with a confirmed case of COVID-19."

In a [March 30 press release][5], New York Attorney General Letitia
James called the firing "disgracefulâ€¦. immoral and inhumane."
