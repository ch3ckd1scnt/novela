  * The US Army assessed in early February that the coronavirus could kill as many as 150,000 Americans, the Daily Beast [reported][1] Thursday, citing an unclassified briefing document.
  * The "black swan" or worst-case scenario assessment has become nearly the [best-case scenario][2] for the US as the White House warns that the virus may kill 100,000 to 240,000 Americans.
  * The number of coronavirus cases in the US has already topped 200,000, and more than 5,000 people have died.

The US Army assessed in early February that the coronavirus could kill
as many as 150,000 Americans, [the Daily Beast reported Thursday][1],
citing an unclassified briefing document.

The document put together on Feb. 3 by US Army North [had a "black swan"
assessment][1] that 80 million Americans could be infected, 15 to 25
million could require care, 300,000 to 500,000 could require
hospitalization, and 80,000 to 150,000 could die.

While the Army briefing document was reportedly seen by the heads of US
Northern Command and US Army North and sent to senior Army leadership,
it is unclear if the document was passed further up the chain, the Daily
Beast [reported][1].

A "black swan" assessment is basically a worst-case scenario projection.

"The reality of it is that you want us planning for the worst-case
scenarios, you want us planning for the what ifs—us thinking ahead into
all those things that might and could possibly happen and that's what
we've been doing, not only on this particular effort but on a myriad of
different threats we face to the homeland," NORTHCOM commander Gen.
Terrence O'Shaughnessy explained at the Pentagon Wednesday.

This worst-case scenario, [as the Daily Beast's James LaPorta and
Spencer Ackerman noted][1], is becoming a [best-case scenario][2] for
the US.

The White House coronavirus task force [has assessed that 100,000 to
240,000 Americans could die from the virus][4], even with ongoing steps
to mitigate its effects. The president called the numbers "sobering," as
did others on the task force.

"We, as sobering a number as that is, we should be prepared for it.  Is
it going to be that much?  I hope not," Dr. Anthony Fauci, a top
infectious disease expert and an important member of the task force,
[said][5] Wednesday of the possibility of 100,000 Americans dying from
the virus. "Being realistic, we need to prepare ourselves that that is a
possibility, that that's what we will see."

Throughout February and March, President Donald Trump repeatedly
downplayed the threat posed by the coronavirus.

In late February, Trump [tweeted][6] that "the Coronavirus is very much
under control in the USA." A few days later, he [said the number of
cases][7] in the US was going down and would be "close to zero" in a few
days.

The president [admitted Tuesday that he had been downplaying the
outbreak in the US][8]. "I knew everything. I knew it could be
horrible," he said, explaining that he just didn't "want to be a
negative person."

There are, according to latest statistics, [more than 200,000 cases in
the US, and more than 5,000 people have died][9] as a result of the
coronavirus. The coronavirus has [spread to more than 900,000 people
worldwide and claimed over 46,000 lives][10].
