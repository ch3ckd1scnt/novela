We could all probably use some extra apparel that doubles as outdoor
activewear and loungewear right now, so you can stay comfy whether
you’re working from home or heading out for a hike. Fortunately,
[REI][1] is now taking 25 percent off a bunch of popular brands like
Patagonia, Nike, Smartwool, and more. REI is our go-to destination for
outdoor gear, but it turns out the retailer has plenty of pieces that
are comfortable enough to lounge in indoors, too. Since a lot of this
apparel is made out of special performance fabrics, they’ll transition
nicely from your at-home workout to a string of video conferences. We’re
sharing our 10 favorite picks from this REI sale to help you find the
right piece to add to your wardrobe now.
