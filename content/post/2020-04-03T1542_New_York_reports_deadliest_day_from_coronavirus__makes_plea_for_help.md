NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York suffered its deadliest single day from the
novel coronavirus, with 562 additional deaths in the last 24 hours for a
total of 2,935 fatalities, by far the most of any U.S. state, Governor
Andrew Cuomo said on Friday.

Cuomo warned that people were "going to die in the near term" due to a
lack of ventilators and hospital beds and called for resources from
across the United States to be deployed to New York to help it deal with
the growing crisis in the state - the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak.

"New York is in crisis. Help New York. Then pick up... and then go to
the next place as this rolls across the country," Cuomo told a daily
briefing on the public health crisis. "Thatâ€™s how we beat this damn
virus as it marches across the country."

Cuomo said he had spoken with Alibaba Group Holding <BABA.N> co-founder
Jack Ma and was getting help from the Chinese e-commerce giant in
sourcing materials from China, the biggest producer of personal
protective equipment (PPE) in short supply for medical workers.

The governor, who has emerged as a national voice on the coronavirus
response, said he would sign an executive order to take ventilators and
PPE from facilities in the state that have them and do not need them to
deal with the virus.

"If they want to sue me for borrowing their excess ventilators to save
lives, let them sue me," Cuomo said, responding to a question of whether
the order could be challenged legally. "I'm not going to let people
die."
