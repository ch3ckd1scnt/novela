(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump warned Iran against what he said
was a possible “sneak attack” the Islamic Republic was planning against
U.S. troops in Iraq.

Trump indicated in a tweet that the U.S. had “information” about a
possible attack but didn’t elaborate. He said Iran would pay a “very
heavy price” if there’s an attack.

Tensions have soared this year between Washington and Tehran after a top
Iranian general was killed by American forces at the start of the year,
prompting a missile barrage on an Iraqi base used by American forces.
There have since been strikes in Iraq by Iranian proxy groups, and the
U.S. has seized shipments of allegedly Iranian weapons bound for Yemen.

More recently, Iran and some other countries have called on the U.S. to
ease sanctions to allow for faster importation of humanitarian goods
needed to help fight the coronavirus outbreak, which has hit Iran
particularly hard. The U.S. argues that its sanctions already allow for
the importation of critical goods.
