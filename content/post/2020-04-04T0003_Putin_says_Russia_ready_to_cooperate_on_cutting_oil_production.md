Moscow (AFP) - Russia is ready to cooperate with Saudi Arabia and the
United States to cut oil production, President Vladimir Putin said
Friday.

Putin said Russia was willing to make agreements within the framework of
the OPEC+ group and that "we are ready for cooperation with the United
States of America on this issue," according to a statement published by
the Kremlin.

"I believe that it is necessary to combine efforts in order to balance
the market and reduce production."

Oil prices have tumbled in recent weeks in the face of a drop in demand
and global economic uncertainty over the new coronavirus pandemic.

Last month, OPEC and its allies failed to reach a deal on oil production
cuts after OPEC+ leader Moscow refused to tighten supply to counter the
effects of the coronavirus outbreak.

Speaking with Energy Minister Alexander Novak via conference call, Putin
said Russia was prepared to discuss "a reduction in the volume of about
10 million barrels a day, a little less, maybe a little more."

He said Russia was in close contact with partners Saudi Arabia and that
he recently spoke to US President Donald Trump.

The Kremlin on Thursday denied Putin spoke to Saudi Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman after Trump made the claim on Twitter, and oil
prices rocketed.

Putin's comments come as the OPEC group of oil producers led by Saudi
Arabia plan to meet Monday via videoconference, according to a source
close to the organisation.
