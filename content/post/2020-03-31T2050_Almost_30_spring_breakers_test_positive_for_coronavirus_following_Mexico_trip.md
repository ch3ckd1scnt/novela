Almost 30 students who recently traveled to Mexico for spring break have
tested positive for COVID-19.

Health officials in Austin, Texas, on Tuesday [announced][1] an
investigation into a "cluster" of COVID-19 cases among a group of
roughly 70 people in their 20s who traveled in a chartered plane to Cabo
San Lucas, Mexico for spring break about a week-and-a-half ago amid the
coronavirus crisis.

"Currently, 28 young adults on this trip have tested positive for
COVID-19 and dozens more are under public health investigation," the
Austin Public Health Department said. "Four of the confirmed cases did
not present any symptoms."

The 28 people who tested positive are currently self-isolating, and more
are being monitored while quarantined, according to the statement. The
University of Texas at Austin [told NBC News][2] that the 28 young
adults with COVID-19 are students at the school. Some individuals who
went on the trip came back home on commercial flights, according to the
Austin Public Health Department's statement.

Austin officials said that although Mexico wasn't under a federal travel
advisory when the young adults traveled there, "Austin-Travis County
residents should follow CDC's travel recommendations indicating
travelers avoid all non-essential international travel," and "a leisure
vacation of any kind is not considered essential." The University of
Texas at Austin told NBC that this serves as a "reminder of the vital
importance" of following health officials' warnings amid the coronavirus
pandemic.
