APFELSTAEDT, Germany (Reuters) - Countries' procurement agents are
fighting each other in China for access to the protective equipment that
must play a key role in stemming the spread of the novel coronavirus,
German Health Minister Jens Spahn said.

He was responding to a spate of reports of consignments of protective
masks destined for European countries being bought up by United States
officials, sometimes even as aeroplanes stood ready for departure on the
tarmac.

"You hear stories of people fighting in the truest sense of the word
over these masks in China," he told reporters on Friday during a visit
to a logistics company that is acting for the German government. "That's
not a good development, but it reflects the strong demand."

Germany's mix of lockdown measures and aggressive testing for the novel
coronavirus has so far been successful in slowing the spread of the
disease, with each patient only infecting one other on average in recent
days.

But that development, while encouraging, has focused more attention on
the supplies of protective equipment that will become necessary if the
disruptive curfews in force are ever to be lifted.

"This crisis is not a sprint but a long-distance run," Spahn said,
warning the public not to expect a sudden or complete relaxation of
lockdown and quarantine rules.

He said Europe was in a strong position to manufacture much of the
protective equipment it needed, even in the face of international
competition for the output of the largest suppliers in China.

"We make masks only on a small scale here in Germany, but we build the
machines that are used to make the masks," he said.

"And much of the animal fleeces that are used to make the masks are
produced in Europe and Germany. So if the machines and the fleeces are
from Germany and Europe, we should be able to have production in Europe
again."
