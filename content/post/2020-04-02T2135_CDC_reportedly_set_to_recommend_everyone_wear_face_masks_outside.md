New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio issued a recommendation Thursday to
wear face coverings when going outside, and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention is reportedly set to do the same.

The public should use homemade cloth face coverings when outside and
reserve medical-grade masks for health care workers, a draft CDC
document [obtained by _Stat News_ reveals][1]. A CDC official [later
told _The New York Times_][2] the same guidance would soon be issued.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti already told his city to wear masks on
Wednesday. Like the CDC guidelines are set to recommend, de Blasio told
New Yorkers not to buy N95 masks that hospital workers desperately need.

  

  

The White House's top coronavirus doctor Anthony Fauci [said Tuesday][3]
that the CDC would consider issuing a mask recommendation once they were
more widely available and that the coronavirus task force would be
discussing the proposal that day.
