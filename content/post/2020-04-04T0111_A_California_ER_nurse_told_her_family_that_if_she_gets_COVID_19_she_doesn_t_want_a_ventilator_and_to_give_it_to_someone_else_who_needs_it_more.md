An [emergency room nurse][2] working in Southern California told
Insider, the pandemic had forced her to have some difficult
conversations with her family.

Paige, who asked to conceal her last name said while she's found it too
difficult to have the conversation with her 86-year-old father, she's
discussed how she wants her family to deal with her death if she were to
be infected and die from the coronavirus with her sisters.

"If I were to get really sick, my sisters know I don't want to take a
ventilator from someone else who may need it," she said.

Business Insider previously [reported][3] the US does not have enough
ventilators to handle the influx of coronavirus patients.

Paige explained that she had conversations with other nurses in hard-hit
states who described discussions on who would get a ventilator and who
wouldn't if their hospitals become overburdened.

One of the symptoms of coronavirus is shortness of breath. [Ventilators
are used in intensive care][4] to assist patients who are having trouble
breathing or can't breathe on their own.

A shortage of these supplies in [Italy][5], which has also experienced a
massive outbreak, has also forced hospitals to prioritize who they could
save. In places like the Lombardy region, doctors have to make tough
decisions to protect the young and healthy at the expense of older
patients.

The nurse worries that her exposure to COVID-19 patients without proper
protective equipment could put her at risk of catching the virus and
spreading it.

She said she's been reusing the same N95 mask for at least five shifts.
It is meant only to be used once for a single patient encounter. She's
concerned that she could be infected every time she puts the mask back
on.

Paige explained that while her hospital has been trying to procure more
personal protective equipment for staff, the national shortage is making
it difficult. For now, they gave her a gift bag to carry the gear she'll
have to reuse.

"It's not a gift. It feels like a joke. It feels like a cruel joke," she
said of having to carry around the gift bag.

For now, Paige is isolating herself from her family. Despite the
shelter-in-place orders, she won't visit her father for his 86th
birthday, fearing she could put him at risk.

"I can't be the reason my dad dies," she said, explaining that she had a
tough conversation with him, so he knows how to protect himself.
