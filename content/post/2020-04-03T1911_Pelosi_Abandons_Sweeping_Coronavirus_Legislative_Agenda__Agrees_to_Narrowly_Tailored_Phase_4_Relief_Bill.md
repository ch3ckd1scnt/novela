House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday indicated she would support a
phase-4 coronavirus relief bill without a broad infrastructure plan or
many of the other unrelated legislative goals she initially called to be
included in the legislation.

“I’m very much in favor of doing some of the things that we need to do
to meet the needs of clean water, more broadband, and the rest of that.
That may have to be for a bill beyond this,” Pelosi [told][1] CNBC.
“Right now, I think that we have a good model. It was bipartisan, it was
signed by the President, but it’s not enough.”

“Let’s do the same bill we just did, make some changes to make it
current,” Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill Friday, [according to
_Politico_][2].

The CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) Act agreed
upon by Congress and signed by President Trump last Friday provides $2.2
trillion in economic relief to individual Americans, small businesses
and large corporations such as Boeing that have been affected by the
Wuhan coronavirus pandemic.

“The acceleration of the coronavirus demands that we double down on the
down payment we made in CARES by passing a CARES 2 package. We must
extend and expand this bipartisan legislation,” Pelosi told [CNN][3].

Pelosi’s previous push to include infrastructure legislation came after
President Trump [wrote][4] on Twitter in support of the idea.

“We have never, ever gone down a path that involves this much investment
for the future, involving this many people in our country, and again now
at this time, we’re having a further health urgency, an immediate
urgency,” Pelosi [told][5] reporters on Wednesday.

Republicans, however, have been [wary][6] of adding provisions that are
not directly aimed at containing the coronavirus outbreak and the
resulting economic damage after Democrats attempted to shoehorn
environmental and corporate diversity regulations into previous relief
bills.

During negotiations over the CARES Act in March, House Majority Whip
James Clyburn told colleagues that the bill [represented][7] “a
tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.”
Legislation inserted into the bill by Democrats included tougher carbon
emissions limits for airlines, mandatory reports on diversity for
corporate boards, and more tax credits for solar and wind energy.
Republican senators including [Tom Cotton][8] of Arkansas and [Ben
Sasse][9] of Nebraska slammed the additions.
