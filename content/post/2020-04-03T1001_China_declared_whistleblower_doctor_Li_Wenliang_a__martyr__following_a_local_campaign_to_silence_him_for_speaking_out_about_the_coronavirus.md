  * In December, police in Wuhan made Li admit to lying about the existence of a worrying new virus discovered in the city. Li died on February 7 after contracting the virus. 
  * An investigation by the Chinese Communist Party [found on March 19][2] that the actions of law enforcement in Wuhan was "irregular" and "improper."

China named Li Wenliang — the doctor who sounded the alarm about the
[coronavirus][4] that later [killed him][5]  — a "martyr" following a
campaign to silence him by police in Wuhan.

Li was among 12 dead medics given the official honor by the Chinese
Communist Party on Thursday, [according to state media outlet CCTV.][6]

"Martyr" is the highest honor the Communist Party can bestow on a
citizen killed working to serve China, according to [the state-run
Global Times tabloid.][7]

Li was an ophthalmologist working at Wuhan Central Hospital. In late December, he shared with his colleagues on popular instant-messaging service WeChat [a worrying diagnostics report][8] that identified a new illness which [looked much like severe acute respiratory syndrome][9] (SARS).

That turned out to be the [novel coronavirus][10] which has now infected
more than 1 million people around the world.

Authorities in Wuhan immediately pounced on Li, and made him sign a
letter admitting he was "spreading rumors" and "making false comments."

Li later contracted the coronavirus and [died of it on February 7][5] in
Wuhan Central Hospital, his place of work.

Just days before his death Li [told The New York Times][11] by text: "If
the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier I
think it would have been a lot better. There should be more openness and
transparency."

His death was met with an outpouring of anger from many Chinese people,
who used a [number of hashtags][12] calling for freedom of speech, an
end to state censorship, and an apology to Li.

That anger appeared to have struck a nerve with the Chinese government.
On March 19, the country's top anti-corruption agency, the National
Supervisory Commission (NSC), [ruled that Li's punishment was
"irregular" and "improper."][2]

The NSC said the police must be held responsible and that Li's
punishment should be rescinded, [according to Reuters][13].

China has proactively [censored content on social media][14] that is
critical of the state's response to the coronavirus crisis. In early
March, a new law came into effect which [criminalized the posting of
"illegal" and "negative" content critical of the government online][15].

At 10 a.m. local time on Saturday, the whole of China will observe a
three-minute silence to honor all martyrs who died fighting the
coronavirus, [Xinhua reported][16].
