While announcing a statewide shelter-in-place order on Wednesday,
Georgia governor Brian Kemp, a Republican, said that he had just been
informed that asymptomatic individuals could spread the coronavirus.

The illness “is now transmitting before people see signs….Those
individuals could have been infecting people before they ever felt
[symptoms],” Kemp [said][1] at a press conference. “We didn’t know that
until the last 24 hours.”

It has been widely known for months that the coronavirus can spread
through asymptomatic transmission. However, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention recently updated its guidelines for outbreak
mitigation regarding asymptomatic transmission, leading Georgia health
officials to change their projections for an outbreak in the state.

“It’s a combination of recognizing there’s a large number of people out
there who are infected and who are infected, who are asymptomatic, who
never would have been recognized under our old models, but also seeing
the community transmission that we’re seeing,” said Dr. Kathleen Toomey,
head of Georgia’s Department of Public Health.

Governor Kemp had initially resisted signing a shelter-in-place order
due to the effect it would have on the state’s economy. However, in
recent days the governors of Florida, Texas, and South Carolina all
introduced limitations on residents’ mobility to combat coronavirus
spread. Georgia has 4,748 confirmed cases, with Florida at 7,773, Texas
at 4,607, and South Carolina at 1,293, according to Johns Hopkins
University’s coronavirus [tracker][2].

With the extent of coronavirus spread across the U.S. becoming clearer,
Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday [said][3] the outbreak in the U.S.
was increasingly comparable to that of Italy, one of the worst outbreaks
in the western hemisphere.
